Project Objective: To create and store a 3D object, apply transformations (rotate, scale, sheer), generate different projections etc.
Progress Report:
Week 1 implementation: Creation of 3D object.
I have used the example of a house and created three elevations for it namely top view, front view and side view.
For implementing this I have used the salable vector graphics in html 5.
Challenges faced:
I had to learn the concept of scalable vector graphics(SVG) and all the elements associated with it and then had to implement the same.
Future Scope: In the coming weeks I will be using this week’s implementation and will try to implement the mentioned features in the project objective.
