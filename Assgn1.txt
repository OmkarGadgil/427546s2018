title="SSG: superpixel segmentation and GrabCut-based salient object segmentation",
journal="The Visual Computer",

month="Jan",
day="22",
abstract="Saliency detection is a popular topic for image processing recently. In this paper, we propose a simple, robust and fast salient object segmentation framework. Firstly, we develop a novel saliency map segmentation strategy, named SSG which consists of superpixel region growing, superpixel Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering and iterated graph cuts (GrabCut), where DBSCAN makes similar background regions cluster as a whole, region growing groups similar regions together as much as possible, GrabCut segments salient objects accurately. Then, the proposed SSG is combined with saliency detection to abstract salient objects. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the favorable performance than many recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, F-measure and execution time.",

abstract="In this paper, we describe a method to create an approximate ray-traced stereoscopic pair by transforming a fully raytraced left-eye view into an inferred right-eye view. Performance results from evaluating several random scenes, which indicate that the second view in a stereoscopic image can be computed with as little as 5{\%} of the effort required to fully ray-trace the first view, are presented. We also discuss worst-case performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that our technique is always at least as efficient as two passes of a standard ray-tracer.",
